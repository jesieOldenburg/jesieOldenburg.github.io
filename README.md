## About Me
I'm a UI/UX designer & front-end developer. I'm crazy about making software and the web more enjoyable for everyone to use. I enjoy finding solutions to the unique challenges each discipline presents me, from pixel alignment in my designs to identifying and fixing bugs in my code.

I constantly strive to improve my skills and realize that there is no ceiling to my knowledge. I will never use a progress bar to measure my skills, as I can always be improving my craft. While I may be skilled in a particular scope, I always push the boundaries of what I know and challenge myself to grow as both a designer and developer. I genuinely enjoy keeping up with trends, learning about the latest tech, and experimenting with new techniques.
