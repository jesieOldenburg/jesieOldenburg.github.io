        My Journey

    <p class="leadp">
        I moved from California when I was 20 years old, after I joined the Army in 2008. By Feburary 2010 I was on my first deployment to Afghanistan.
        <br> I served as an Infantryman during my 9 years in the Army, and transitioned out of the service in November 2017. Once I was out I attended Nashville Software School’s Front-End Web Developer UI/UX Designer Cohort-24.

        I grew up around my father’s fabrication shop in Huntington Beach, CA. It was certainly a great environment for me to grow up in. I had access to all different sorts of tools, scrap metals, and old gadgets, such as printers.This environment allowed me
        to create things in a way most other kids, or grownups for that matter, get to experience. In addition to his hands on tools, my father has CNC machines, which he maintains, programs and operates all himself. Learning how to arc weld at the ag
        of 7 is very cool to a young man.

        You may be wondering how I went from marksmanship and marching to code and design. The answer has a lot to do with who I am, what I like, and how I think.

        I earned my first degree black belt at age ten. I began racing Karts at the age of 12 and continued until the age of 18. I love music. I love creating it, listening to it, writing it… You get the point… My drum kit is my happy place.
