                For 30 years DP Racing has been fabricating performance parts for vintage Datsun street-cars & racers.  As the premier business in Southern California for niche auto parts, DP Racing sought a new, modernized look for their webpage, in addition to an admin console for managing product data.

            <p class="right-align-text">
                With keeping a focus on updating page layouts, styling and elements, I began the Design phase.  Extra attention was payed to updating the UI elements of the page using brand colors to maintain consistent styles across the page.

            Identifying a client's specific problem is key to ensuring their website Design intent is met. Research findings from user interviews proved  invaluable in defining clear issues with measurable goals, as well as a concise Problem Statement.

            Great Design requires knowing your target user and viewing a project from their perspective.  After adequate user research was complete, the project's persona, "Mario",  was born.  Once this persona was finalized, all decisions moving forward were based on his ideal experience on the site.
